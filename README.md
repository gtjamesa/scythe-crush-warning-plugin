# Scythe/SRA Crush Warning [![Plugin Installs](http://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://api.runelite.net/pluginhub/shields/installs/plugin/scythe-crush-warning)](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/gtjamesa)

Have you finished an Araxxor task before heading straight into ToB and realising at Xarpus that your Scythe's attack style is on crush? Then, this plugin is for you!

The overlay hides automatically at Araxxor/Nightmare/Hueycoatl/Cerberus/Royal Titans. SRA is also supported.
